        description: `After Englishman John Blackthorne is lost at sea, he awakens in a place few Europeans know of and even fewer have seen—Nippon. Thrust into the closed society that is seventeenth-century Japan, a land where the line between life and death is razor-thin, Blackthorne must negotiate not only a foreign people, with unknown customs and language, but also his own definitions of morality, truth, and freedom. As internal political strife and a clash of cultures lead to seemingly inevitable conflict, Blackthorne’s loyalty and strength of character are tested by both passion and loss, and he is torn between two worlds that will each be forever changed.`,

        I thought it was the end when my car flew off a cliff. But a beautiful goddess stepped in and offered me a second chance.
        Now I have the power of light itself within me, and that power is growing.
        Which is just as well, because I have to battle villains, monsters, mutants and more.
        I’m not a natural born superhero, but just maybe, I can become something more.`,
